    <h1>Django Framework</h1>
    <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It was created to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently, with a focus on reusability, less code, and the principle of "don't repeat yourself" (DRY).</p>
    
    <p>Django provides a robust set of features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for database interactions, an admin interface for managing application data, and built-in security features to protect against common web vulnerabilities. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern.</p>
