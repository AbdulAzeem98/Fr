    <h1>Spring Framework</h1>
    <p>Spring is a powerful framework for building Java applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, allowing developers to focus on building their business logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</p>
    
    <p>Spring is widely used for building enterprise-level applications and offers features such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, and more. It also supports various modules like Spring MVC for web applications, Spring Boot for microservices, and Spring Data for data access.</p>
