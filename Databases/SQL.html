    <h1>SQL Database</h1>
    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used for querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data in a database. SQL is essential for database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
    
    <p>SQL allows users to perform operations such as creating tables, defining relationships between tables, and executing complex queries to retrieve specific data. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, and business intelligence applications.</p>
