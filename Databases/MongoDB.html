    <h1>MongoDB Database</h1>
    <p>MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and provides high availability, scalability, and flexibility. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it easy to change the data structure without downtime.</p>    
    <p>MongoDB is often used for applications that require fast data access and the ability to handle large volumes of data, such as real-time analytics, content management systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It supports rich queries, indexing, and aggregation operations, making it a powerful choice for modern application development.</p>
